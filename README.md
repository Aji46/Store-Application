# Flutter App with Home and Notifications Screens

This is a Flutter application built using the MVC architecture and Provider state management. The app consists of two main screens: a **Home Screen** and a **Notifications Screen**. JSON data is parsed from an API endpoint and displayed on the notifications screen. For enhanced performance.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Initial landing page displaying static content (per design).
- **Notifications Screen**: Displays data parsed from a JSON endpoint.
- **Provider State Management**: Manages state effectively across screens.

## Architecture

This project uses **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to maintain code modularity, and **Provider** is utilized for state management to ensure efficient data flow and responsiveness.
